## About 
Entertain Me will allow users to be matched with entertainment to match their mood, and will be catered to their personal mood-dependent habits. When they sign up they will give us some details on what type of media they search for when they are in a certain headspace. For example if they are in need of uplifting, what are the top 5 type of films they will turn to? From then on they will be able to input their ‘mood’ and we will return to them personally curated selection of their chosen media type ( films, tv shows, games, books). Our users will be able to store favourites to refer back to in the future, which they can access on their user dashboard.
